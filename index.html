                    <p>The Mactan Shrine in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu was established in 1969 as national shrine through Republic Act No. 5695 during the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos. The site is believed to be the approximate location of the historic Battle of Mactan which saw the defeat of the Spaniards led by explorer Ferdinand Magellan against Lapu-Lapu the datu of Mactan and his forces. The legislation included the Magellan Monument a structure which was erected back in the Spanish colonial era in 1866. Republic Act No. 5695 also mandated for a monument for Lapu Lapu, who is regarded as hero for his role in the historic battle in 1521 as well as the erection of a Liberty House, a facility which would exhibit memorabilia showcasing the Philippines' history prior to the arrival of the Spanish. In 1981, a bronze statue depicting Lapu-Lapu was erected within the shrine.</p>

                    <p>We started with a visit to the local 911 center.</p>

                    <h4>Loboc River Cruise</h4>
                    <p>The Loboc River is a scenic river in Bohol, Philippines, known for its emerald green waters flowing through lush jungle scenery. It is a popular tourist destination offering unique experiences like floating restaurants, cultural performances, and water activities</p>

                    <h4>Baclayon Church</h4>
                    <p>Baclayon Church, officially the Immaculate Conception Parish Church, is one of the oldest stone churches in the Philippines, constructed with coral stones and egg whites as cement between 1717 and 1727. Founded by Jesuit priests in 1596, it was the site of the first Jesuit mission in Bohol, featuring a separate bell tower completed later in 1777. The church is a historic landmark, with the exterior walls bearing the Jesuit insignia and the original structure still largely intact.</p>

                    <h4>Chocolate Hills</h4>
                    <p>Chocolate Hills in Bohol Island: Everything You Need to Know ...The Chocolate Hills are a unique geological formation in Bohol, Philippines, consisting of around 1,776 cone-shaped hills spread over an area of more than 50 square kilometers. Covered in grass, the hills turn a distinctive chocolate-brown color during the dry season, which is how they got their name. These hills are believed to be formations of weathered limestone, raised above sea level and then sculpted by erosion over millions of years.</p>

                    <h4>Man-Made Forest & Tarsiers</h4>
                    <p>The Bohol man-made forest, also known as the Bilar Man-Made Forest, was created starting in 1968 as a reforestation project to combat deforestation caused by logging and agricultural expansion. The two-kilometer stretch of densely planted mahogany trees, located between the towns of Loboc and Bilar, was a collaborative effort between the government and the local community. It is a symbol of successful reforestation and has become a popular tourist attraction.The Philippine Tarsier is a small, nocturnal primate found in Bohol, known for its enormous eyes, which are larger than its brain, and its ability to rotate its head nearly 180 degrees. It measures about 3.3 to 6.3 inches long, weighs between 80 and 160 grams, and has a long, thin tail that is often longer than its body. These shy creatures are difficult to spot because their soft, furry bodies blend with their surroundings, and they are sensitive to noise and light, especially during the day when they sleep.</p>
